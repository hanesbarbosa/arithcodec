Russia has moved most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine, after pulling back its forces from near the capital Kyiv. Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky says the battle for the area known as Donbas has begun and a very large part of Russia's army is taking part.

What would Vladimir Putin need before he could claim success in his goal of "liberating" Ukraine's old industrial heart and is that possible?

Ukraine's best-trained forces were already posted in the east because of an eight-year war with Russian-backed separatists. They are thought to have suffered heavy losses, but are still a significant challenge to Russia's invading army.

Russian forces have already triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the east, but are still not in control of the port city of Mariupol. Ukraine's president has said "we will fight for every metre of our land" and Russia's new offensive could herald a protracted conflict.
What is Ukraine's Donbas?

When President Putin talks of Donbas, he is referring to Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. What he really means is the entirety of two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border.

"The key is that it has been identified by the Kremlin as a Russian-speaking part of Ukraine that is more Russia than Ukraine," says Sam Cranny-Evans of the Royal United Services Institute.

These areas may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. "Mariupol was one of the most pro-Russian cities in Ukraine and to level it is beyond my comprehension," says defence specialist Konrad Muzyka, head of Rochan Consulting.

A month into the war, Russia claimed to have taken control of 93% of Luhansk region and 54% of Donetsk. Russia's president is still a long way from subduing the entire area, but even if he were to be able to claim victory, this is a very large territory to control.
Why Putin wants to control Donbas

The Russian leader has repeatedly made the unfounded accusation that Ukraine has carried out genocide in the east.

When the war began, almost two-thirds of the eastern regions were in Ukrainian hands. The rest was run by Russian proxies, who created Moscow-backed statelets during a war that began eight years ago.

Just before the war, President Putin recognised all of the two eastern regions as independent of Ukraine.

If Russia were to conquer both big regions, it would give Vladimir Putin some sort of achievement from Russia's war. The next step would then be to annexe Donbas, just like he did with Crimea after a discredited referendum in 2014.

And if it came before 9 May, he would even be able to celebrate on Victory Day, when Russia's military still marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.

Russia's puppet leader in Luhansk has already spoken of having a referendum in the "near future", although the idea of even a sham vote in a war zone seems absurd.
What is Putin's strategy?

Ukraine's military believes he wants full control not just of Donbas but also of the southern region of Kherson, to the north and west of Crimea. That would give him a land bridge along the south coast to the Russian border and control of the water supply to Crimea.

Much of Donetsk and key areas of Luhansk are still in Ukrainian hands, so Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukraine's army in the east, moving in from the north, east and south. "This is a big territory to control, and I think we shouldn't underestimate the geographical complexities of this," says Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King's College London.

They have so far failed to capture Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv south of the Russian border, but they have seized control of Izyum - a strategic town further down the main motorway heading into the separatist-controlled east.

"If you look at what they're doing around Izyum, it's following the main lines of the highways and that would make sense, given that they're moving most of their equipment by road and rail," says Prof German.

The towns now in Russian sights have already experienced years of war since Russian-backed separatists first seized large parts of Donbas.

The next big target down the M03 road is Slovyansk, a city of 125,000 people that was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014 before being recaptured. Capturing Kramatorsk, just to the south, is also a big objective.

The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says if Ukraine holds on to Slovyansk, Russia's campaign to seize both regions "will likely fail".

Russian forces have attacked a succession of Ukrainian-controlled towns in Luhansk as they advance from the north and east. They have entered Kreminna, to the north-west of Severodonetsk and have bombarded towns including Rubizhne, Popasna and Lysychansk.

These towns are important because controlling them would enable Russia to drive west and link up with Russian forces pushing south-east of Izyum, says the ISW. That is why Ukraine's military is concentrating its counterattacks in that area outside Izyum.
More than 200 people were evacuated from Severodonetsk on Thursday

The Russians need to control the supply lines by road and block Ukrainian access to rail routes from the west. Rail is the most effective transport for Ukrainian troops and heavy weaponry and it is the fastest route out for fleeing civilians.

Controlling parts of the rail network would also enable Russian forces to move their troops and supplies.

Regional military administration head Serhiy Haidai believes Russia's goal is to destroy everything blocking their way in order to achieve Vladimir Putin's target of reaching Luhansk's western regional borders.

Maryna Agafonova, 27, fled her family's home in Lysychansk, leaving her parents behind as Russian shells continued to fall. "They attacked hospitals and residential buildings. There is no heating and no electricity."

Civilians are being moved out ahead of the Russian advance. "It's far more scary to remain and burn in your sleep from a Russian shell," warned Mr Haidai.

Train lines have been cut to Izyum in the north and to Mariupol and Melitopol in the south. Services have been disrupted from Slovyansk and no trains have run from the nearby hub of Kramatorsk since a rocket attack killed 57 people as they waited to board trains.
Can Ukraine's forces hold out?

At the start of the war, the 10 brigades that made up Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation (JFO) in the east were regarded as the best-equipped and best-trained soldiers that Ukraine has.

"We don't really know the strength of Ukrainian forces now," said Sam Cranny-Evans of Rusi, who believes their numbers will have been boosted by volunteers in recent weeks.

"The main goal for the Ukrainians is to inflict as big losses on the Russian side as possible and the Ukrainians are using asymmetric tactics to avoid big battles," says Konrad Muzyka.

US officials say Russia now has 76 battalion tactical groups in the east, having added 11 to the area in recent days, and more being resupplied north of the border. They typically number 700 to 900 men.

Despite their reinforcements, there is widespread scepticism that Russian forces will achieve any breakthrough fast. ISW believes they may be able to wear down Ukrainian positions but likely at high cost, while Ukrainian military experts believe many of Russia's battalion groups are in poor condition.

Russian forces have already sustained high losses after seven weeks of conflict and morale is thought to be low. Their units are made up of men enlisted from the local separatist areas, many under duress, as well as the broader Russian army. 

'Scary' existence in separatist Luhansk

Life under the control of Russian-backed separatists is quieter, although separatist authorities have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling residential buildings and killing civilians. Officials in the Donetsk statelet say 72 civilians have died since mid-February. Far more have been killed in Russian attacks on Ukrainian-controlled territory.

One woman in Luhansk told the BBC on condition of anonymity that she had seen a lot of Russian military armour in the city and the atmosphere now was one of fear and caution.

"I'm scared - it's just scary," she said. Men of military age were required to join the local Russian proxy militia, so anyone who avoided the draft was in hiding, she explained.

"They're mobilising [men] on the streets, catching them. There are no men in the shops, in town, on the streets." As a result, all male-dominated businesses are shut, she said.

"We're already Russia, although just informally. Everyone has a Russian passport."

Ammunition stockpiles aboard a Russian ship that was famously defied by Ukrainian troops early in the war have detonated, according to a statement from the Russian defence ministry.

A fire caused the explosion on the Moskva, the statement in Russian media said, adding that all sailors had evacuated beforehand.

The statement said: "The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship.

"The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated."

It did not specify the cause of the fire.

But earlier on Wednesday, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet was hit by Ukrainian rockets, according to the governor of Odesa.

Ukrainian officials said Russia was struggling to rescue the estimated 510 crew members on board.

The Moskva warship rose to fame early in the war when Ukrainian defenders of Snake Island refused calls to surrender and told the Russian ship to "go to hell", before they were ultimately taken prisoner.

Germany must draw up a schedule to withdraw from using Russia's gas supply, the head of energy utility association BDEW, Marie-Luise Wolff, has said.

There is pressure on Germany to stop providing funds for the Kremlin to wage war and to guard itself against a sudden stop of exports on the Russian side.

It comes as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he had offered to visit Ukraine with other EU leaders, but Kyiv had told him he was not welcome due to his close ties with Russia and his support for the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to double the flow of Russian gas to Germany.

"We must now use all our energy to prepare our exit from Russian gas supplies in detail and to underpin the necessary measures with an ambitious timetable," Wolff said.

Germany's leading economic institute said a Russian energy supply freeze would cause a recession in 2023 and has slashed its 2022 growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy because of the impact of the war in Ukraine.

In his nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky argues that if Russia fails to pursue a peace agreement they must leave the international community forever.

"Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace or as a result of this war Russia will leave the international arena forever," he says.

Speaking about Russia's increasing strikes in the east and south, he said: "All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity.

"To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers... the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine.

"Well, we do everything to justify their doubts."

He also reiterated his call for a total embargo of Russian oil, saying: "The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine."

Zelensky expressed gratitude to President Biden after he pledged another massive weapons shipment to Ukraine.

If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the latest developments:

US military aid

    The US has pledged another weapons shipment to Ukraine which President Biden said would give Ukrainian forces "new capabilities" in the fight against Russian invaders
    The shipment includes helicopters, backpack-worn Switchblade drones - also known as "kamikaze drones" - and howitzer cannons, armoured vehicles and other supplies
    It come after Biden accused Russia of "genocide" - a term that other countries such as France have been reluctant to use 

'Crime scene' call

    In Bucha war crimes prosecutors visiting the site of civilian killings have called Ukraine a crime scene. "We have reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed," the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said
    The presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia visited President Zelensky in Ukraine, and also toured the formerly-occupied town of Borodyanka
    A major European security organisation says there are clear patterns of Russian troops violating international humanitarian law. A panel of OSCE experts said it had found credible evidence of torture and other punishments 

Mariupol latest

    Earlier, Russia said more than a thousand Ukrainian marines had surrendered in the besieged port of Mariupol. But a Ukrainian presidential adviser insisted the city had not fallen
    Fighting in Mariupol, which has been left in ruins after a six-week assault, appears to be continuing around the Azovstal industrial district. If Russia takes the area it would reportedly have full control of the city

Russia threatens to hit Kyiv command centres

The Russian military has threatened to strike Ukraine's command centres in the capital, Kyiv, if there are continued attacks on its territory.

"We are seeing Ukrainian troops' attempts to carry out sabotage and strike Russian territory," the Russian defence ministry claimed in its regular evening briefing.

"If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike decision-making centres, including in Kyiv," it added.

Russia has accused Ukraine of shelling its territory before, including an alleged attack on an air base last month.In 2016, Maryna Viazovska, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, dazzled mathematicians by identifying the densest way to pack equal-sized spheres in eight- and 24-dimensional space (the second of these in collaboration with four co-authors). Three years later, she and her co-authors proved something even more remarkable: The configurations that solve the sphere-packing problem in those two dimensions also solve an infinite number of other problems about the best arrangement for points that are trying to avoid each other.

The points could be an infinite collection of electrons, for example, repelling each other and trying to settle into the lowest-energy configuration. Or the points could represent the centers of long, twisty polymers in a solution, trying to position themselves so they won’t bump into their neighbors. There’s a host of different such problems, and it’s not obvious why they should all have the same solution. In most dimensions, mathematicians don’t believe this is remotely likely to be true.
But dimensions eight and 24 each contain a special, highly symmetric point configuration that, we now know, simultaneously solves all these different problems. In the language of mathematics, these two configurations are “universally optimal.”

The sweeping new finding vastly generalizes Viazovska and her collaborators’ previous work. “The fireworks have not stopped,” said Thomas Hales, a mathematician at the University of Pittsburgh who in 1998 proved that the familiar pyramidal stacking of oranges is the densest way to pack spheres in three-dimensional space.

Eight and 24 now join dimension one as the only dimensions known to have universally optimal configurations. In the two-dimensional plane, there’s a candidate for universal optimality — the equilateral triangle lattice — but no proof. Dimension three, meanwhile, is a zoo: Different point configurations are better in different circumstances, and for some problems, mathematicians don’t even have a good guess for what the best configuration is.

“You change the dimension or you change the problem a little bit and then things may be completely unknown,” said Richard Schwartz, a mathematician at Brown University in Providence. “I don’t know why the mathematical universe is built this way.”

Proving universal optimality is much harder than solving the sphere-packing problem. That’s partly because universal optimality encompasses infinitely many different problems at once, but also because the problems themselves are harder. In sphere packing, each sphere cares only about the location of its nearest neighbors, but for something like electrons scattered through space, every electron interacts with every other electron, no matter how far apart they are. “Even in light of the earlier work, I would not have expected this [universal optimality proof] to be possible to do,” Hales said.

“I’m very, very impressed,” said Sylvia Serfaty, a mathematician at New York University. “It’s at the level of the big 19th-century mathematics breakthroughs.”

It might seem strange that dimensions eight and 24 should behave differently from, say, dimension seven or 18 or 25. But mathematicians have long known that packing objects into space works differently in different dimensions. For instance, consider a higher-dimensional sphere, defined simply as the collection of points some fixed distance from a center point. If you compare the sphere’s volume to that of the smallest cube that fits around it, the sphere fills up less and less of the cube as you go up in dimension. If you wanted to ship an eight-dimensional soccer ball in the smallest possible box, the ball would fill less than 2 percent of the box’s volume — the rest would be wasted space.

In each dimension higher than three, it’s possible to construct a configuration analogous to the pyramidal orange arrangement, and as the dimension increases, the gaps between the spheres grow. When you hit dimension eight, there’s suddenly enough room to fit new spheres into the gaps. Doing so produces a highly symmetric configuration called the E8 lattice. Likewise, in dimension 24, the Leech lattice arises from fitting extra spheres into the gaps in another well-understood sphere packing.

For reasons mathematicians don’t fully understand, these two lattices crop up in one area of mathematics after another, from number theory to analysis to mathematical physics. “I don’t know of a single root cause for everything,” said Henry Cohn, of Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, Mass., one of the new paper’s five authors.
For more than a decade, mathematicians have had strong numerical evidence suggesting that E8 and the Leech lattice are universally optimal in their respective dimensions — but until recently they had no idea how to prove it. Then in 2016, Viazovska took the first step by proving that these two lattices are the best possible sphere packings (she was joined, for the Leech lattice proof, by Cohn and the other three authors of the new paper: Abhinav Kumar, Stephen Miller of Rutgers University and Danylo Radchenko of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany).
While Hales’ proof for the three-dimensional case filled hundreds of pages and required extensive computer calculations, Viazovska’s E8 proof came in at just 23 pages. The core of her argument involved identifying a “magic” function (as mathematicians have come to call it) that provided what Hales called a “certificate” that E8 is the best sphere packing — a proof that might be hard to come up with, but that once found carries instant conviction. For example, if someone asked you whether any real number x makes the polynomial x2 – 6x + 9 negative, you might be hard-pressed to reply. But if you realized that the polynomial equals (x – 3)2, you would immediately know that the answer is no, since squared numbers are never negative.

Viazovska’s magic function method was powerful — almost too powerful, in fact. The sphere-packing problem only cares about interactions between nearby points, but Viazovska’s approach seemed as if it might work for long-range interactions as well, like those between distant electrons.

 Viazovska, Cohn and their collaborators restricted their attention to the universe of repulsive forces. More specifically, they considered ones that are completely monotonic, meaning (among other things) that the repulsion is stronger when points are closer to each other. This broad family includes many of the forces most common in the physical world. It includes inverse power laws — such as Coulomb’s inverse square law for electrically charged particles — and Gaussians, the bell curves that capture the behavior of entities with many essentially independent repelling parts, such as long polymers. The sphere-packing problem sits at the outer edge of this universe: The requirement that the spheres not overlap translates into an infinitely strong repulsion when their center points are closer together than the diameter of the spheres.

For any one of these completely monotonic forces, the question becomes, what is the lowest-energy configuration — the “ground state” — for an infinite collection of particles? In 2006, Cohn and Kumar developed a method for finding lower bounds on the energy of the ground state by comparing the energy function to smaller “auxiliary” functions with especially nice properties. They found an infinite supply of auxiliary functions for each dimension, but they didn’t know how to find the best auxiliary function.
In most dimensions, the numerical bounds Cohn and Kumar found bore little resemblance to the energy of the best-known configurations. But in dimensions eight and 24, the bounds came astonishingly close to the energy of E8 and the Leech lattice, for every repulsive force Cohn and Kumar tried their method on. It was natural to wonder whether, for any given repulsive force, there might be some perfect auxiliary function that would give a bound exactly matching the energy of E8 or the Leech lattice. For the sphere-packing problem, that’s exactly what Viazovska did three years ago: She found the perfect, “magic” auxiliary function by looking among a class of functions called modular forms whose special symmetries have made them objects of study for centuries.
